The main goal of this project is learning React and simulating "real world" developing process (nice files organization, using git etc...). Through developing process I learned a lot about the organization and git so I used a lot of that stuff while working on this project, especially when it comes to git and github. I did not know about branches, pull request etc... so first commit is done without any of that stuff, just working on main branch. Later from that I created branch and pull request for every component/page and component's/page's logic.
